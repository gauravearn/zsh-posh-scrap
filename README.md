# ZSH_POSH_web_scrapping
ZSH_POSH_web_scrapping: Yesterday night i was finishing my installation of the mac for the final ones and was installing the oh-my-posh and also the fonts and found that there are couple of nerd fonts you can install and there is no automated way to do it. So i thought of writing a bash based webscrapping for the same. I tried to post this on linkedin but no access till Monday and from Tuesday onwards i am not available till July end 2023 on Linkedin. So here it is how to do it. 

if you have any questions, I am reachable at
