# ZSH_POSH_web_scrapping
ZSH_POSH_web_scrapping: Yesterday night i was finishing my installation of the mac for the final ones and was installing the oh-my-posh and also the fonts and found that there are couple of nerd fonts you can install and there is no automated way to do it. So i thought of writing a bash based webscrapping for the same. I tried to post this on linkedin but no access till Monday and from Tuesday onwards i am not available till July end 2023 on Linkedin. So here it is how to do it. 

The snipped you can use. The check.txt is the contents of the webpage, you can use curl -o to take all the webpage contents from the nerd fonts https://www.nerdfonts.com/
and save it as text and then you can use the first command to save the contents from the page to all_fonts.txt and then use the second line to install the font which you like.
